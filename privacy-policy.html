    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 9, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Your Budget</strong> ("the App") handles your information. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>The App does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit any personal data</strong> to external servers. All data you enter in the App (budgets, expenses, savings goals, reminders) is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All your financial data is stored locally on your device using the device's built-in storage. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your data never leaves your device</li>
        <li>No data is sent to any server or cloud service</li>
        <li>No account or registration is required</li>
        <li>Uninstalling the App will permanently delete all your data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. No third parties have access to your data.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App does not require any special device permissions such as camera, location, contacts, or internet access for its core functionality.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since no data is collected from any user, the App is safe for users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.</p>
